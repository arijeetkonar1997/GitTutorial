When it comes to zero defect delivery ensuring that the code is error-free at the preproduction stage is very important. Firstly to get a clear understanding of the requirements I document each of them on a personal level at the requirement gathering stage when I receive them from the BA. In doing so I make sure that there is no gap in understanding point of view before I start development. Hence strong research and continuous seeking of clarifications from the BA ensures that my basis of development is correct. This is the first step towards zero leakage of defects. Now after development getting the code unit tested and peer-reviewed by my leads is the second gateway towards a zero leakage development. Thirdly when I push the code to the subsequent environment namely the test and stage I take active ownership and accountability for resolving the bugs that may have occurred in those environments.
